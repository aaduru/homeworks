          <h2 id=description>Description</h2>
            <p>
              The Kofta is an Indian name for a fried meatball. In the vegetarian version, this meatball is made with either Paneer or Potato (aloo) or a combination of vegetables.
            </p>
            <p>
              The gravy can be a plain Tomato Onion tadka or a more richer and calorie dense Mughlai Gravy. We call it Mughlai primarily because it adds milk and Cream on top of usual Tomato and Onions.
            </p>

          <h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
            <h3>Making Paneer Kofta</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Start with either shredding or mashing with hand the Paneer. Add Baking Powder, Cornflour and 1/4 tsp of salt. Mix it well. Addition of milk here is optional. Generally, the rule of thumb that we follow is that if the Paneer is hard
                </li>

                <li>
                  Pick small amount of this Paneer mix in you palm and roll it with other palm, to get the round shape of kofta. The idea is to make balls with diameter of about 1.5 Inch each.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Now press it at the center with the thumb to flatten. Place 2 Raisin at the center of this flattened ball i.e. in its stomach. Roll it back again into a ball shape. This way, the Raisin would be embedded inside the ball and that's exactly what we want.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make more of such Kofta in a similar fashion util you finish up the whole mix. Once done, they will be ready for frying.
                </li>
              </ol>
            <h3>Frying Paneer Kofta</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Heat oil in a frying pan. Once Oil is hot, add the Kofta balls in and fry until they get golden brown in color evenly on all sides.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stir them with the spatula with light hand stroke, else, they can break in pieces. Once done, take them out from the Oil. Keep Kofta balls directly on a paper napkin to soak the extra Oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One you have fried all the Kofta, you can keep them aside. We would need them later when we are done with the Mughlai Gravy.
                </li>
              </ol>
            <h3>Making Mughlai Gravy</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  In a pan heat 4 Tbsp of Oil. After 2 minutes, Chop the Onion and fry them in hot Oil on high flame until they turn pink in color. It should take about 4 minutes to turn pink. Once they turn light pink, take them out of frying pan and keep aside to cool to room temperature. You can consider 3 minutes to be a good time for bringing the temperature down. Once done, add it to the grinder jar and grind to make a smooth and fine paste. Keep this paste aside for later use.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add Tomato in a pressure cooker along with 1/2 cup water. Close the cooker lid and let it make 1 whistle on high flame. After a whistle, switch Off the stove. Let the steam go Off on its own i.e. do NOT force open the lid. Once all steam has vanished from the cooker, open it and take out the boiled Tomatoes.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Peel the skin of the Tomato. Since tomato is in boiled state, it can easily be taken Off just a slip of your finger. Be careful as Tomato is hot. Use a plate to hold the Tomato and you can wait for 2 minutes if you are not able to handle the hot ones. After removing the skin, let them sit aside for 3 minutes. This will help them come down to room temperature. After 3 minutes, grind and make a smooth paste using a grinder. Keep this paste aside for use later.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Grate Ginger and Garlic into fine strings. Chop the Green Chilies into small circular pieces. Do NOT add these chilies to ginger garlic yet. Grate Almond and Cashew nuts to make a fine powder. We need to convert this powder into a paste.  Hence, add 1 cup of water and 1 tsp of roasted Khus-Khus. Grind once again. You will now get the thick paste. Keep it aside too for use later. We are now ready with all the pastes and other ingredients that are required to make Mughlai gravy.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Heat 2 Tbsp of Oil in a pan. After 1 minute, turn the stove on medium flame. Open the face of all 4 Black Cardamom (break open at their center) and add them in hot Oil along with Bay Leaves. Cook until they become light golden brown in color. It should take about 1 minute. Add grated Ginger, Garlic and green Chili. Cook until they become light golden in color. It would take 1 minute too.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add Onion paste and mix well. Let it cook until Onion paste turns brown in color. This would take about 5 to 7 minutes.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Once you see the brown color of Onion, Add Tomato paste. Cook until Tomato paste is separated from the Oil. This step would take about 5 minutes.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Now, add Cashew-Almond paste, Salt, Garam Masala, 1/2 Cup (Our 1 Cup = 240 ML) water and 1/2 Cup (Our 1 Cup = 240 ML) Milk. Mix well and cook for 2 minute. After 2 minutes, add the Cream (or Malai) and you can now see the light Orange color that gravy has achieved. Let it cook on medium flame until it takes one (1) boil. This would take 2 minutes.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Once you see the boil in the gravy, Your Mughlai creamy gravy is ready. Add Paneer Koftas (or you can say meatball) that we prepared earlier. Use a Spatula to pour the Mughlai gravy on the Koftas. Switch Off the stove. Your delicious Malai Kofta is ready to serve.
                </li>
              </ol>
