# We use `includes` when we need to prefetch an association and
# use those associated records. If we only want to *aggregate* the
# associated records somehow, `includes` is wasteful, because all
# the associated records are pulled down into the app.
#
# For instance, if a `User` has posts with many, many comments, we
# would pull down every single comment. This may be more rows than
# our Rails app can handle. And we don't actually care about all
# the individual rows, we just want the count of how many there
# are.
#
# When we want to do an "aggregation" like summing the number of
# records (and don't care about the individual records), we want
# to use `joins`.
